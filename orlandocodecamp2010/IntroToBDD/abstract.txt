Behavior Driven Development is the natural evolution from Test Driven Development and involves a deeper understanding of business logic attached to specifications. Far too often we design our software from a technical perspective when we should be focusing on the domain instead. BDD addresses specifically that. All tests that are written can be attached to expectations dictated by the stakeholder, which in turn are realized via source code. Contrary to popular belief, TDD is not a requirement before getting started with BDD and the community has found that BDD is easier for newcomers to learn than traditional TDD. Come learn how to writer some specs and make your software behave more like it was intended.
